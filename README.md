# Awesome Configuration

## Acknowledgements

* This theme is a fork from [Powerarrow] (https://github.com/esn89/powerarrow) from user @esn89
* I use the GTK stylings from @vincentbernat's [Awesome Configuration] (https://github.com/vincentbernat/awesome-configuration)

## Install

* Install Awesome Window Manager
    ```shell
    # apt-get install awesome awesome-extr
    ```

* Download files and copy to ~/.config/awesome, so the load path for rc.lua is ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua
* Run in awesome mode.
* Everything should be generic for your system, but many of the installed applications, etc. are not standard (such as scientific software). Install what you want, but I do not recommend using this configuration.
* I also use the Ambiance-Dark-Blue GTK theme from NoobsLab, which can be installed from their Ubuntu PPA.

## Other Notes

* Configured to work with pulseaudio
* Has a custom bottom panel similar to a dock, which disappears on maximization
* Edited naughty/notify to enable custom tooltips above the cursor
